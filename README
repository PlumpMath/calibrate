Creating a panda3d task to calibrate eye position for Iscan. 

tests still need:

check that all intervals being tested for manual and random

I think we should reload same square if misses fixation, and this should not
affect total number of squares shown.


Manual and Random Sequence:

square moves (either set at beginning or by square_moves (4)
goes directly to square turns on (0)

Random:
once square turns on, check for fixation
once fixated, start timer for how long to fixate
if breaks fixation or leaves fixation window, goes to move without reward
(checks fixation window every time receive new eye position)

If fixates:
goes through normal sequence loop:
square changes color (1)
square turns off     (2)
reward               (3)
moves to new spot and turns on (one step) (4-1)

Manual:
square changes color  (1)
square turns off      (2)
reward                (3)
after reward leaves main loop and goes directly to waiting for key press
if interval ends and no key press, defaults to center
moves and then goes back into main loop and waits for color change (1)
